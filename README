The Math::Cephes module provides a perl interface to over
150 functions of the cephes math library of Stephen Moshier.
Please read the INSTALL file for instructions on installation.
The functions available are grouped as

- trigonometric: sin, cos, etc., and their inverses; also 
  included are versions of sin, cos, tan, and cot which accept
  angles in degrees, as well as a degree to radian converter.

- hyperbolic: sinh, cosh, tanh, and their inverses.

- exponential and logarithmic: exp and log functions,
  with versions in base e (2.718282...), base 10, and base 2.

- Bessel functions: various Bessel functions (J, Y, I, K)
  of different orders.

- Gamma functions: the gamma function, the incomplete gamma 
  integral and its inverse, and the digamma function (psi).

- Beta functions: the beta function and the incomplete
  beta integral and its inverse.

- elliptic integrals: complete, incomplete, and Jacobian
  elliptic integrals.

- hypergeometric functions: 2F0, 2F1, 1F2, 3F0, and the
  confluent hypergeometric function.

- distributions: binomial, beta, chi-square, F, gamma, normal,
  Poisson, and Student's t distribution, as well as their inverses.

- miscellaneous: Airy function, Dawson's integral, exponential
  integrals, error functions, sin/cos and sinh/cosh integrals,
  Fresnel integral, dilogarithm (Spence integral), the Struve
  function, and the Riemann zeta functions.

- utilities: square and cube roots, ceiling, floor, round, pseudo random
  number generators, the power function, the factorial function, and
  some others.

Some common constants, such as PI and SQRT2, are also available.
As well, there is support for arithmetic operations for fractions 
(adding, subtracting, dividing, multiplying) and also for various 
functions of complex numbers (arithmetic, trigonometric, hyperbolic, 
exponential, logarithm, powers). Interfaces to these are available
in the included Math::Cephes::Fraction and Math::Cephes::Complex
modules.
  
A description of these functions and their usage may be read 
either as a man page (man Math::Cephes) or through perldoc 
(perldoc Math::Cephes).

A simple "calculator" script (pmath) is included which provides 
a command line interface to this module; help on the various functions 
is also available within this script. The script will use the 
Term::ReadLine module if available. Help on its usage is available 
either though the man page (man pmath) or perldoc (perldoc pmath).

Missing from this perl interface are some functions in the
cephes library which manipulate polynomials and matrices;
their inclusion will hopefully come later. The module has
been built and tested on a Linux and on a Win98 machine 
(including ActiveState's Perl); to build on different systems will
probably require editing of the file libmd/mconf.h, which
among other things defines the type of computer arithmetic
used. If you need to edit this file for your system, please
let me know of the changes needed, so they can be automatically
set in a future release.

If you are running ActiveState's Win32 perl (build version 6xx), a
ppm package of this distribtion may be installed via

ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppmpackages/Math-Cephes.ppd
