Revision history for Math::Cephes

0.40    Dec 20, 2003

  - move Cephes_wrap.c and arrays.c to top-level directory
    and configure Makefile.PL to build static libmd.
  - generate a mconf.h for darwin (thanks to Thomas Puzia)
  - upgraded Cephes_wrap.c swig wrapper
  - prepended md_ prefix to many functions, to avoid
    collisions with system functions (thanks to Thomas
    Puzia and David Martin for pointing out the problem)

0.36    Sept 12, 2002

  - added functions that require arrays into and out from
    C (simpson's rule, polynomial and matrix routines).
  - added Math::Cephes::Polynomial and Math::Cephes::Matrix
  - added Solaris mconf.h that mostly works (thanks to
    Jost Krieger).

0.25	Oct 25, 2000

  - changed Cephes_wrap.c to compile when MULTIPLICITY
    in perl 5.6.0 is defined (addition of pTHX_)

0.20    Mar 12, 2000

  - changed name from Math::Functions to Math::Cephes
  - added Math::Cephes::Fraction and Math::Cephes::Complex
    for a more "perlish" interface
  - added '-g -Wall -fno-builtin' when compiling with gcc
  - small documentation improvements
  - some changes to the pmath script, including the interface
    to handle fractions and complex numbers
