This module requires a C compiler to build. To install the 
module, first edit libmd/mconf.h to suit your system (the 
default settings are for Linux/Win32).Then execute the sequence

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you do not have permission to install modules in the
Perl site tree on your system, you can install this in
your own library by

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl \
     INSTALLMAN1DIR=/home/me/man/man1 \
     INSTALLMAN3DIR=/home/me/man/man3
   make
   make test
   make install

To use modules in this location, either set the PERL5LIB
environment variable to include your private module
directory, or else put

   use lib '/home/me/perl/path/to/lib';

at the top of your script.

If you need to alter libmd/mconf.h to work on your
system, I would be interested in knowing what settings
were required, so as to make this configuration automatic.
